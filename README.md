## Robotic Applications and Design 
---
This repository houses projects using the iRobot Create2 in Robotic Applications and Design at the University of South Carolina.
All projects are written in Python and reference the [iRobot Interface Spec](https://www.irobotweb.com/~/media/MainSite/PDFs/About/STEM/Create/iRobot_Roomba_600_Open_Interface_Spec.pdf?la=en).
