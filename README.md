### Project_One
My local work for the first generation of my algorithm to test. Generates vectors of n size fill with random integers, and then sorts if desired (heapsort + quicksort).

### Project_Two
This directory houses the working enviroment for the source code to live in. It also contains a few scripts for zipping and compiling the project.

### Project_Three
In this directory, I used docker to build a container and run the gem5 simulator in. This takes out the stress of trying to rework my file paths and install all of the dependancies to gem5 on MacOS.

### Project_Four
This directory holds my python scripts that I used to run the gem5 simulator, in additon to the output files containing the statistics for the simulations.
